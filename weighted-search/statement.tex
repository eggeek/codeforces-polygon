Alice and Bob are playing a game (again!):

Alice choices a number $x$ in mind and let Bob guesses.
At the beginning, Bob only knows that $x$ is in range $[l, r]$,
and in each time he guesses a number $y$, Alice tells him the relationship between $x$ and $y$.
Bob needs to pay price $a$ if $x<y$, and price $b$ if $x>y$.
The game keep going until Bob finds the correct value of $x$.

Bob wants to know the minimum cost to find the correct number in the worst case.

\section{Input}
The first line contains two integers $1 \le l \le r \le 100$,
the second line contains two integers $1 \le a, b \le 100$.


\section{Output}
One line contains two integers:

 $x$, the choice of Alice that maximum Bob's cost,
 and $c$ the corresponding cost if Bob plays in the best strategy.
