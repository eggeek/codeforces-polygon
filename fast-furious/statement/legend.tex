The road network is an \textbf{infinite} 4-connected grid map, Farmer John is driving his broken car from $(s_x,\ s_y)$ 
to repair station $(t_x,\ t_y)$. The start location and repair station are in different places,
and $t_x \ge s_x, t_y \ge s_y$.

At the time $0$, Farmer John is at $(s_x,\ s_y)$ and start driving, the speed of car is 1 cell per second.
Due to some mechanical issues, the broken car \textbf{can not stop} until reaching the repair station, and Farmer John has to change the direction in every $m$ seconds.

For example, he is free to change or not change direction from $1$ to $m-1$ seconds, but he has to change direction at the $m$ second, and so on.

What's the minimum time for Farmer John to reach the repair location?
