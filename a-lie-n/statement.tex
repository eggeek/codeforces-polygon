There are some aliens from 3 different planets:
2-eyed planet, 3-eyed planet, 4-eyed planet.
As you can imagine, all aliens that live on the 2-eyed planet have 2 eyes,
all aliens that live on the 3-eyed planet have 3 eyes and all aliens that live on the 4-eyed planet have 4 eyes.

If two aliens have the same number of eyes,
then they feel each other (for the sake of this problem, assume that an alien feels itself as well).
Moreover, two aliens may or may not feel each other if their number of eyes differ by exactly one. The feeling does not need to be mutual (i.e., it is possible that alien $x$ can feel alien $y$, while alien $y$ does not feel alien $x$).

Now we have a report from n aliens:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $(A_1, B_1, C_1),$
	\item $(A_2, B_2, C_2),$
	\item $\ldots,$
	\item $(A_n, B_n, C_n),$
\end{itemize}

where $(A_i,B_i,C_i)$ is the number of 2-eyed aliens,
3-eyed aliens, 4-eyed aliens the ith alien can feel.
Given this data,  determine whether these reports can be true, or at least one of the aliens must have lied.
