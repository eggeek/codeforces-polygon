A palindrome is just an integer that reads the same backwards and forwards - so 6, 11 and 121
are all palindromes, while 10, 12, 223 and 2244 are not (even though 010=10, we don't consider
leading zeroes when determining whether a number is a palindrome).

\t{Square palindrome} is a number that is a palindrome and the square of a palindrome at the same
time. For instance, 1, 9 and 121 are square palindrome, while 16, 22 and 676 are not. (16 is
not a palindrome, 22 is not a square, and while 676 is a palindrome and a square number, the
square root 26 is not a palindrome.)

Given an interval, your task is to compute how many square palindromes in this interval.
