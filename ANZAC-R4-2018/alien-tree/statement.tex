Daniel is doing his PhD on genealogy specializing in family trees of aliens.
Different from human, aliens reproduce by fission, and Daniel notices that the family tree of aliens is
nothing different from tree in computer science: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Except the true anscestor alien, each alien has exactly one parent;
  \item Each alien may have multiple children;
  \item Obviously there is no cycle in the family tree;
\end{itemize}

Daniel has an array of integers describes the total degree of each node
(the total number of edges connected to such node) in a family tree,
and he is interested in the maximal distance of those aliens.

The distance of two aliens is the smallest number of steps along the family tree.
In each step the alien can move from the current node to any of its children, or to its parent.
The distance between an alien and itself is zero.
