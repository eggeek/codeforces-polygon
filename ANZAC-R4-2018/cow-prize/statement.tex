Today is ANZACOW round four, cows are excited. They are going to prepare prizes for teams!
Since dairy factory close on Saturday, there are only three ingredients available:
\textbf{apple}, \textbf{banana} and \textbf{candy}. 

Cows combine these ingredients and produce three types of prizes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Type 1}: one apple, one banana and one candy;
  \item \textbf{Type 2}: one apple and two banana;
  \item \textbf{Type 3}: two apple and one banana;
\end{itemize}

Cows have $a$ apples, $b$ bananas and $c$ candies, they wrap up prizes and sent to teams
one by one. To bring teams more surprises, they guarantee that adjacent prizes are in different
types. Now, cows want to know the maximum number of teams can get prize.
