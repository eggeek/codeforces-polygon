You have an array with $n$ integers: $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$. Count the number of ways to
split all the elements of the array into three contiguous parts so that the sum of elements in
each part is the same.

More formally, you need to find the number of such pairs of indices $i,j$ ($2 \le i \le j \le
n-1$), that:
$$
  \sum_{k=1}^{i-1}a_k = \sum_{k=i}^{j}a_k = \sum_{k-j+1}^{n}a_k
$$
