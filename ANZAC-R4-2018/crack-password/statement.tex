Recently we update the security system in Monash Claytown campus, 
the new system now supports unlimited length of password.

Password in the system is an integer (it can be as large as you want), and for the sake of
security, instead of storing password itself, we store the \text{compressed-key} of password in
our database, where \text{compressed-key} is the sum of each digital of the password, for
example, the \text{compressed-key} of password \text{12390} is \text{15} ($1+2+3+9+0$).

Given a compressed-key, what's the minimum value of the corresponding password?
