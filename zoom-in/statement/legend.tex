The pattern on cow's body is like the fingerprint of human, it is unique!
Farmer John wants to utilizes this property to identify his cows, but he has bad sight,
so he is going to buy a magnifier.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.8, natwidth=250, natheight=200]{cow-pattern.jpg}
\end{center}

A magnifier can magnify 2D image by \t{x-scale} along the width and by \t{y-scale} along the height,
Given the original pattern on cow's body, what does it looks like from the magnifier?
