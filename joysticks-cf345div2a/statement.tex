Friends are going to play console. They have two joysticks and only one charger for them.
Initially first joystick is charged at a1 percent and second one is charged at a2 percent. You
can connect charger to a joystick only at the beginning of each minute. In one minute joystick
either discharges by 2 percent (if not connected to a charger) or charges by 1 percent (if
connected to a charger).

Game continues while both joysticks have a positive charge. Hence, if at the beginning of
minute some joystick is charged by 1 percent, it has to be connected to a charger, otherwise
the game stops. If some joystick completely discharges (its charge turns to 0), the game also
stops.

Determine the maximum number of minutes that game can last. It is prohibited to pause the game,
i. e. at each moment both joysticks should be enabled. It is allowed for joystick to be charged
by \textbf{more than 100 percent}.
