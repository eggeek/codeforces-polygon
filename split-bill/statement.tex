The best moment after an ANZAC Round is enjoying steaming pizza, while the most annoying moment
is spliting the bill. Each team has three members, and they want to split the bill in ICPC
style:

Let $n$ be the price of the bill, $f(n)$ is a function that compute the digital sum of $n$
(i.e. $f(123) = 1 +  2 + 3 = 6$). Team members want to split the bill into three part $a,b,c$
($a+b+c=n$), such that $f(a) = f(b) = f(c)$.
