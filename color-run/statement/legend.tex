Color Run, the most popular sport event in Farmer John's farm,
is a unique event that celebrates healthiness, happiness, and individuality.
During the event, cows will be doused from head to tail in colored powder,
each cow only has a single color and different cows can have different colors.

Today is the Color Run day, there are $n$ cows stand in a line,
and each cow has a set of their favorite colors (cows can only recognize colors from \textbf{1} to \textbf{10}).
To show the respect to individuality, cows must get a color in their favorite color set,
and their standing order can't be changed.

Farmer John has a large coloring machine that each time can douse a single color on a \textbf{continuous} segment of cows,
and he wants to run his machine in minimum number of times.
