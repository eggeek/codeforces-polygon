Cows are addicted to Assassin's Creed, they start to mock the Leap of Faith -
jumping from Farmer John's aircraft and landing in the haystack in front of their barn!
Because cows are big fan of \t{Game of Thrones}, such behavior is also called Cow's Landing.

The farm is in a $2^n$ by $2^n$ grid map, row increases from top to bottom,
column increases from left to right,
and each of cows lives in different barn in a single cell (each cow fit only one barn and each barn fit only one cell).

One day, cows decide to play Cow's Landing in a special order:

\begin{itemize}
  \item They divided the $2^n$ by $2^n$ grid map into four parts (see the figure above):

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \t{A}: $row \in [1, 2^{n-1}]$, $column \in [1, 2^{n-1})$;
    \item \t{B}: $row \in [1, 2^{n-1}]$, $column \in (2^{n-1}, 2^{n}]$;
    \item \t{C}: $row \in (2^{n-1}, 2^{n}]$, $column \in (2^{n-1}, 2^n]$;
    \item \t{D}: $row \in (2^{n-1}, 2^n]$, $column \in [1, 2^{n-1}]$;
  \end{itemize}

  \item All cows live in \t{A} jump first, then \t{B}, \t{C} and \t{D};
  \item Cows in the smaller region $x$ ($x \in \{A,B,C,D\}$) will apply same ordering recursively.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
For example, if $n=2$, the jumping order of the cow in each barn is:
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c c c c|}
      \hline
      1   &   2   &   5   &   6   \\
      4   &   3   &   8   &   7   \\
      13  &   14  &   9   &   10  \\
      16  &   15  &   12  &   11  \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Cows live in \t{A} jump first, so \t{1, 2, 3, 4} are in \t{A}.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item In \t{A}, the cow lives in \t{(1, 1)} jumps first, then \t{(1, 2)}, \t{(2, 2)} and \t{(2, 1)}.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Cows live in \t{B,C,D} also apply the same ordering recursively.
  \end{itemize}
\end{center}


Farmer John very cares about his employees, he has prepared $m$ first-aid kits.
Given the rank of a cow in the order, Farmer John needs to know the location of such cow.
